    "\n",
    "**Answer 3:** The conclusion will be based on what happens when a group of subjects use the drug to treat sore throats. Most sore throats eventually go away on their own, and some sore throats are hard to relieve, so the company can make two kinds of mistake: incorrectly concluding that the drug works when in fact it does not, and failing to notice that an effective drug works. \n",

    "\n",
    "First, randomly sample volunteers into two group, where group A tests for the new drug while group B test for a placebo (drug with no active ingredients). We measure the volunteers' body weight difference from the start until the end of the study. We then found that group A lose body weight, but group B does not gain or lose body weight. To determine whether the new drug works, we make the null hypothesis which is the weight difference in those who receive the new drug is the same as those who receive the placebo. If this were true, what is the probability (p-value) of discovering a body weight reduction in those treated with the new drug (Group A) compared with the placebo (Group B)? This p-value measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. We then use t-test to determine the p-value. "
